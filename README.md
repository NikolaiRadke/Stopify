# What the... are they sawing again?

You're home alone, just sat down with an audiobook â€“ and then it starts. Noise. That was clear. Of course. **Stopify** pauses 
the playback until the noise stops. Simple to build, simple to configure. Save your nerves and build Stopify today!

# WARNING: STOPIFY IS NOT WORKING RIGHT NOW!
Spotiy switched from OAuth2 to PKCE authenticifation process. I have to rework almost everything.

*Oje, Englisch? Kann ich nicht. Schnell [hier hin](https://github.com/NikolaiRadke/Stopify/wiki)*.

Stopify is an audio analysis tool that connects to your Wi-Fi and Spotify account. While a track is playing, it monitors ambient 
noise and pauses Spotify playback when specific sound patterns are detected â€“ such as those produced by a vacuum cleaner, drill, 
or similar. Playback resumes automatically once the noise is gone.

ðŸ†• What's new?  
* **26.05.2025** Reworking auth process from OAuth2 to PKCE. *Sigh*.
